      			<h3>Welcome to Foundation 3.</h3>
      			<p>Foundation 3 is built on 14 years of experience at ZURB building sites and apps for the Web. We believe designing responsively &mdash; designing for all devices, and any device &mdash; is the future. Foundation is our way of helping you to do that. What changed in Foundation 3? Almost everything. Here's what makes Foundation, Foundation.</p>

      			  <div class="four columns">
        			  <h5>Developed with Sass</h5>
        			  <p>Foundation 3 is built with Sass (SCSS, to be precise), a powerful CSS preprocessor which allows us to much more quickly develop and Foundation itself, and sites built with it. If you're comfortable with Sass, getting started is a piece of cake. If you're not, it's still a piece of cake. You can download a pure CSS version of Foundation and work from that, no problem.</p>   			  
      			  </div>
      			  <div class="four columns">
        			  <h5>Feature Complete</h5>
        			  <p>Prototyping with Foundation has always been fast, but now it's even faster. New button elements, new navigation types, new form styles and options, and tons of streamlining make this the fastest way to prototype responsively, and to take that code and go right to production.</p>
      			  </div>
      			  <div class="four columns">
        			  <h5>Freakishly Advanced</h5>
        			  <p>Foundation is the most advanced front-end Web framework in the world. While the Framework works back all the way to IE8, we're taking advantage of new, awesome Web technology to help you build faster and better. And this is just the beginning. You won't believe what else we have in store.</p>

      			<h3>Features of Foundation</h3>
      			<div class="row">
        			<div class="six columns">
          			<h4><a href="grid.php">The Grid</a></h4>
          			<p>Much of the power of Foundation comes from the grid, a 12-column typographic grid designed to work on almost any size device screen. With support for nesting, source ordering, offsets and small device presentation it almost makes this too easy.</p>
          			
          			<h4><a href="typography.php">Typography</a></h4>
          			<p>The typography in Foundation is based on a golden ratio modular scale, so all of your typgraphic elements look great together. Through the power of Sass, the typography is also easy to change both in base size and ratio.</p>
          			
          			<h4><a href="buttons.php">Buttons</a></h4>
          			<p>Buttons are one of the core interactive elements of the Web. We've included styles and patterns for buttons that make it simple to create everything from simple marketing CTAs to complex application toolbars.</p>
        			</div>
        			<div class="six columns">
          		  <h4><a href="forms.php">Forms</a></h4>
          		  <p>A combination of robust, extensible form styles and the built-in power of the Foundation Grid means you can create simple or complicated forms quickly and easily. Validation states, custom select and radio buttons and more are included.</p>
          		  
          		  <h4><a href="navigation.php">Navigation</a></h4>
          		  <p>People have to get around. Navigation styles in Foundation include simple top bars, sidebars, and subnav pills. We've also included a crazy powerful, responsive top bar that supports N-level dropdowns.</p>
          		  
          		  <h4><a href="tabs.php">Tabs</a></h4>
          		  <p>Whether it's pages or simply tabbed content, Foundation's tabs are not only styled up but interactive out of the box.
